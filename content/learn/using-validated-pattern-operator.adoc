= About the {validated-patterns-op}

You can use the {validated-patterns-op} to install and manage {solution-name-upstream}. Use the {hybrid-console-first} to install the {validated-patterns-op}. After installing the Operator, you can create an instance where you can specify the details for your pattern. The {validated-patterns-op} then installs and manages the required assets and artifacts that the pattern requires.

//Include Procedure module here
[id="installing-validated-patterns-operator_{context}"]
== Installing the {validated-patterns-op}

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {ocp} cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the {hybrid-console-first} to the *Operators* → *OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator you want. For example, type `validated patterns` to find the {validated-patterns-op}.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.

[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Select an *Update channel* (if more than one is available).

.. Select a *Version* (if more than one is available).

.. Select an *Installation mode*:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {ocp} cluster.

.Verification
To confirm that the installation is successful:

. Navigate to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

. Check that the Operator is installed in the selected namespace and its status is `Succeeded`.

//Include Procedure module here
[id="create-pattern-instance_{context}"]
== Creating a pattern instance

.Prerequisites
The {validated-patterns-op} is successfully installed in the relevant namespace.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

. Click the installed *{validated-patterns-op}*.

. Under the *Details* tab, in the *Provided APIs* section, in the
*Pattern* box, click *Create Instance* that displays the *Create Pattern* page.

. On the the *Create Pattern* page, select *Form view* and enter information in the following fields:

** *Name* - A name for the pattern deployment that is used in the projects that you created.
** *Labels* - Apply any other labels you might need for deploying this pattern.
** *Cluster Group Name* - Select a cluster group name to identify the type of cluster where this pattern is being deployed. For example, if you are deploying the {ie-pattern}, the cluster group name is `datacenter`. If you are deploying the {mcg-pattern}, the cluster group name is `hub`.
+
To know the cluster group name for the patterns that you want to deploy, check the relevant pattern-specific requirements.
. Expand the *Git Config* section to reveal the options and enter the required information.
.. Change the *Target Repo* URL to your forked repository URL. For example, change `+https://github.com/validatedpatterns/<pattern_name>+` to `+https://github.com/<your-git-username>/<pattern-name>+`
.. Optional: You might need to change the *Target Revision* field. The default value is `HEAD`. However, you can also provide a value for a branch, tag, or commit that you want to deploy. For example, `v2.1`, `main`, or a branch that you created, `my-branch`.
. Ensure that you have made any required changes to your `values-*.yaml` files locally and pushed them to your forked repository on the correct branch or target that you chose in the previous step.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

The {rh-gitops} Operator displays in list of *Installed Operators*. The {rh-gitops} Operator installs the remaining assets and artifacts for this pattern. To view the installation of these assets and artifacts, such as {rh-rhacm-first}, ensure that you switch to *Project:All Projects*.

For more information about post-installation instructions for a pattern, see its _Getting started_ page.
