== Patterns quick start overview

This validated pattern quickstart offers a streamlined guide to deploying predefined, reliable configurations and applications, ensuring they meet established standards. It provides step-by-step instructions on setup, prerequisites, and configuration, enabling administrators to deploy tested, supportable patterns quickly. These patterns simplify complex deployments by applying reusable configurations suited to various infrastructure and application needs, allowing users to efficiently deploy, manage, and scale applications with GitOps. This approach also reduces the risks and time associated with custom configurations.

There are two ways to deploy validated patterns: through the OpenShift-based Validated Patterns framework or the Ansible GitOps Framework (AGOF). The OpenShift-based validated patterns framework is the most common method for deploying applications and infrastructure on the OpenShift Container Platform. It offers a set of predefined configurations and patterns that follow best practices and are validated by Red Hat. 

== Getting Started with Validated Patterns

This guide steps you through the process of deploying your first validated pattern on an OpenShift cluster. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working instance of the Multicloud GitOps pattern, which serves as an excellent foundation for exploring other patterns.

=== What You'll Learn

. Setting up prerequisites for validated patterns
. Installing and configuring the Validated Patterns Operator
. Deploying the Multicloud GitOps pattern
. Managing secrets and configurations

== Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

=== OpenShift Cluster Requirements

* A running OpenShift 4.12 or later
* Cluster-admin privileges
* At least 8 CPU cores available
* Minimum 16GB RAM available

=== Storage Requirements

* A default storage class configured for dynamic provisioning
* At least 10GB of available storage

=== Network Requirements

.For connected environments:
* Access to public container registries
* Access to GitHub repositories

.For disconnected environments:
* Local registry with mirrored operator catalogs
* Local Git repository with pattern manifests
* Proper network policies configured

== Getting Started with Multicloud GitOps

=== What is Multicloud GitOps?

Multicloud GitOps is a foundational pattern that demonstrates GitOps principles for managing applications across multiple clusters. It provides:

* A GitOps framework using ArgoCD
* Infrastructure-as-Code practices
* Multi-cluster management capabilities
* Template for secure secret management

=== Why Start with this Pattern?

The Multicloud GitOps pattern is recommended as your first pattern because:

. It establishes core GitOps practices
. Provides a minimal but complete implementation
. Serves as a foundation for other patterns
. Demonstrates key validated patterns concepts

[NOTE]
====
Other patterns build upon these concepts, making this an ideal starting point for your validated patterns journey.
====

== Installing the Validated Patterns Operator

. Navigate to the OpenShift OperatorHub
. Search for "Validated Patterns Operator"
. Click "Install"
. Select installation mode:
+
[source,yaml]
----
Installation Mode: All namespaces
Installed Namespace: openshift-operators
Update Channel: stable
Approval Strategy: Automatic
----

== Installing the Multicloud GitOps Pattern

=== Creating the Pattern Custom Resource

. Create a new YAML file named `pattern-cr.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: Pattern
metadata:
  name: multicloud-gitops
  namespace: patterns
spec:
  version: latest
  gitSpec:
    targetRepo: https://github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops
    targetBranch: main
----

. Apply the Custom Resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f pattern-cr.yaml
----

=== Verifying the Installation

Monitor the deployment:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n patterns
oc get applications -n openshift-gitops
----

== Configuring Secrets

Secret management in validated patterns follows GitOps best practices while maintaining security. Here's how to configure your secrets:

=== Using Vault for Secret Management

. Access the Vault instance deployed by the pattern
. Initialize Vault and obtain root tokens
. Configure secret engines:
+
[source,bash]
----
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2
----

=== Storing Pattern Secrets

. Create a new secret:
+
[source,bash]
----
vault kv put secret/pattern-name/credentials \
  username="admin" \
  password="secure-password"
----

. Reference secrets in your GitOps configurations:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pattern-secret
stringData:
  credentials: ${vault:secret/data/pattern-name/credentials}
----

[TIP]
====
For more detailed information about secret management, refer to the comprehensive guide at https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/
====

== Next Steps

* Explore the deployed components in your OpenShift console
* Review the GitOps repositories created by the pattern
* Try modifying the configuration to understand the GitOps workflow
* Consider exploring other validated patterns that build on this foundation

[IMPORTANT]
