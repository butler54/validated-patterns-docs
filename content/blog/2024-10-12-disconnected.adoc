== Preamble

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to deploy a Validated
Pattern, specifically the Multicloud GitOps solution on OpenShift 4.16, onto an
OpenShift cluster that has been set up in a disconnected network environment. A
disconnected network, in this context, refers to an infrastructure that is
isolated from external internet access, which adds additional complexity to the
deployment process.

By following this guide, you will learn the necessary steps, best practices,
and specific configurations required to successfully deploy Multicloud GitOps
in such an environment. We will cover the prerequisite setup, key components
involved, and how to manage the constraints posed by the lack of direct
connectivity to external repositories and services. This ensures that even in a
restricted, air-gapped network, the deployment of this validated pattern can be
performed smoothly and securely.


== Requirements

* One or more openshift clusters deployed in a disconnected network
* An OCI-compliant registry that is accessible from the disconnected network
  (referred to as `registry.internal.disconnected.net` in this article)
* A Git Repository that is accessible from the disconnected network
* (Optional) A VM in the disconnected network where we run our commands

We wonâ€™t cover here how to deploy openshift in a disconnected network, as there
is more detailed documentation that can be found
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[here]

== Mirroring

The first step needed to deploy a pattern is mirroring all the needed images.
In most cases this is a very pattern-dependent process, so the exact list of
needed images will depend on the pattern, on the openshift version and on the
needed operators.

In this example we use the tool `oc mirror --v2` (note: it is currently in tech
preview, but the experience is superior compared to the previous release). Here
is an example of such a configuration file `imageset-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
mirror:
  platform:
    graph: true
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.16
      type: ocp
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.16
    packages:
      - name: lvms-operator
      - name: advanced-cluster-management
        channels:
          - name: release-2.11
      - name: multicluster-engine
        channels:
          - name: stable-2.6
      - name: openshift-gitops-operator
        channels:
          - name: gitops-1.13
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.16
    packages:
      - name: patterns-operator
  additionalImages:
  - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest
  - name: registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/vault:1.17.6-ubi
  - name: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/httpd-24:1-226
  - name: ghcr.io/external-secrets/external-secrets:v0.10.2-ubi
  - name: registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/ee-supported-rhel9:latest
  # VP charts
  - name: quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/acm:0.1.3
  - name: quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/clustergroup:0.9.5
  - name: quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/gitea:0.0.2
  - name: quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/golang-external-secrets:0.1.3

  - name: quay.io/hybridcloudpatterns/pattern-install:0.0.3
  - name: docker.io/gitea/gitea:1.21.11-rootless
----

We can use this `imageset-config.yaml` file to mirror the needed images on our
registry. We assume we have a folder (`/var/cache/oc-mirror`) where the tool can
locally cache the downloaded images before pushing them to the internal
registry. We copied the imageset-config.yaml in that folder:

[source,sh]
----
oc mirror --config=/var/cache/oc-mirror/imageset-config.yaml \
    --workspace file:///var/cache/oc-mirror/workspace \
    docker://registry.internal.disconnected.net --v2
----

Once this command completes the `registry.internal.disconnected` OCI registry
will contain the mirrored images. The oc mirror command will generate a few
yaml files that can be found under `/var/cache/oc-mirror/workspace/working-dir/cluster-resources`.

We need to apply them to our cluster:

[source,sh]
----
cd /var/cache/oc-mirror/workspace/working-dir/cluster-resources
oc apply -f cs-community-operator-index-v4-16.yaml \
  cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-16.yaml idms-oc-mirror.yaml \
  itms-oc-mirror.yaml
----

Once these are applied the cluster will be able to fetch the images from the
internal disconnected registry.

== Git repository changes

Note that we assume here that the git folder you are working on has the
`origin` remote pointing to the disconnected git server where you will be
cloning the pattern from. To verify to which git server a remote is pointing to
you can run the `git remote -v` command.

We will need to tweak a couple of things so that the pattern is aware of which
catalog sources in openshift contain the different images. Those names were
defined in the previous mirroring step in the yaml files under
`/var/cache/oc-mirror/workspace/working-dir/cluster-resources`.

`values-global.yaml`:
[source,yaml]
----
main:
  multiSourceConfig:
    enabled: true
    clusterGroupChartVersion: "0.9.*"
    helmRepoUrl: registry.internal.disconnected.net/hybridcloudpatterns
  patternsOperator:
    source: cs-community-operator-index-v4-16
  gitops:
    operatorSource: cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-16
----

`values-hub.yaml`:
[source,yaml]
----
acm:
  mce_operator:
    source: cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-16

clusterGroup:
  subscriptions:  
    acm:
      name: advanced-cluster-management
       namespace: open-cluster-management
       channel: release-2.11
       source: cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-16
----

== Deploy the pattern

At this point we can clone Multicloud Gitops on to a VM that lives in the
disconnected network and deploy the pattern. The only thing we need to do first
is to point the installation script to the mirrored helm chart inside the
disconnected registry.

[source,sh]
----
# Points to the mirrored VP install chart 
export PATTERN_DISCONNECTED_HOME=registry.internal.disconnected.net/hybridcloudpatterns
./pattern.sh make install
----

After a while the cluster will converge to its desired final state and the
MultiCloud Gitops pattern will be installed successfully.
