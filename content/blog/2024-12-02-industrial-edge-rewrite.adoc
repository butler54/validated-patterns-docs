== Preamble

For a long time the Industrial Edge pattern was using an old version of the
Seldon operator to take care of Machine Learning parts of the pattern. 

This caused a few inconveniences: namely you could not install the pattern on
OpenShift 4.14 and later versions because the operator has never been released
for those versions. We also removed the S3 dependency so the pattern can now be
installed on any cloud platform and is not limited to AWS any longer.

Here is a display of the some of the components installed out of the box:

== Improvements 

The pattern underwent a number of improvements:

* *RHOAI* We now install the Red Hat maintained RHAOI operator and its
  components and use those for data analysis, and inference in the pattern.
* *In-cluster Gitea* Now by default the industrial edge pattern will deploy
  using the in-cluster gitea feature, which means there is no need to fork the
  pattern at all. An in-cluster gitea instance will be deployed automatically
  and every component (pipelines, AI notebooks, argo applications, etc) will
  point to it out of the box.
* *In-cluster ODF* we now use the in-cluster ODF operator (driven by a helm
  chart that is used across different patterns), so we do not rely on external
  storage any longer
* *In-cluster S3* we rely on the object storage capabilities exposed by ODF
  which allows us to drop any dependency on external S3 allowing this pattern
  to be installed on any cloud platform
* *OpenShift Pipelines* a larger rewrite was undertaken simplifying the
  pipelines, avoiding some yaml duplication through helm and by consolidating
  things on to a few pipelines. Most tasks have been parallelized so the time
  needed to run them has been reduced substantially
* *Misc* in the old version of the pattern there were still a place where we
  had a demo password encoded in the yaml file. Now we autogenerate it inside
  the cluster and push things around through External Secrets.
* *Misc* By default now the jupyter notebook comes preloaded with some
  notebooks automatically

== In-cluster gitea

The in-cluster gitea feature is documented http://localhost:4000/blog/2024-07-12-in-cluster-git/[here] a bit more.
The pattern will automatically import the upstream github repositories of both the pattern and manuela-dev.

== RHOAI ==

We use the new RHOAI components, whith preconfigured accesses to the S3 buckets
used to store the models, a Data science pipeline and preconfigured Jupyter Notebooks.

== OpenShift Pipelines ==

The pipelines have been completely rewritten in order to simplify them, reduce the
duplication and to parallelize the runs.

The rewrite has been possible thanks to the following people:

* _Max Murakami_
* _Akos Eros_
* _Martin Jackson_
