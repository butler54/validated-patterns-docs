# Demonstrating Industrial Edge example applications

## Background

Up until now the Industrial Edge 2.0 validated patterns has focused primarily on successfully deploying the architectural pattern. Now it is time to see
GitOps and DevOps in action as we go through a number of demonstrations to change both configuration information and the applications that we are
deploying.

If you have already deployed the data center and optionally a factory (edge) cluster, then you have already seen several applications deployed in the
OpenShift GitOps console.

## Prerequisite preparation

### OpenShift Cluster

Make sure you have the `kubeadmin` administrator login for the data center cluster. Use this or the `kubeconfig` (export the path) to provide administrator access to your data center and factory/edge clusters.

## Configuration changes with GitOps

There may be times where you need to change the configuration of some of the edge devices in one or more of your factories. In our example, we have various sensors at the factory. Modification can be made to these sensors using
`ConfigMaps`.

## Accessing the demo application

In this demonstration you will turn on a temperature sensor for sensor #2. Do this first in the data center because this will demonstrate the power of GitOps without having to involve the edge/factory cluster. 

However, if you do have a factory joined using Advanced Cluster Management, then the changes will make their way out to the factory. But it is not necessary for the demo as we have a complete test environment on the data center.

Follow these steps in the OpenShift console to access the dashboard application in a tab on your browser:

1. Select **Networking**->**Routes** on the left-hand side of the console. Using the Projects pull-down, select `manuela-tst-all`. The following screen appears: 

    [![network-routing-line-dashboard](/images/industrial-edge/network-routing-line-dashboard.png)](/images/industrial-edge/network-routing-line-dashboard.png)

2. Click the URL under the Location column for the route Name `line-dashboard`. This will launch the line-dashboard monitoring application in a browser tab. The URL will look like:

    `line-dashboard-manuela-tst-all.apps.*cluster-name*.*domain*`

3. Once the application is open in your browser, click the **Realtime Data** navigation on the left and wait a bit. Data should be visualized as received.

    > **Note:** There is only vibration data shown! If you wait a bit more (usually every 2-3 minutes), you will see an anomaly and alert on it.

4. Now turn on the temperature sensor. Log in using the `gitea_admin` username and the autogenerated password. This password is stored in the `gitea-admin-secret` secret located in the `vp-gitea` namespace. To retrieve it:

    4.1 Go to **Workloads** > **Secrets** in the left-hand menu.

    4.2  Using the Projects pull-down, select the `vp-gitea` project and open the `gitea-admin-secret`.

    4.3 Copy the password found under **Data** into the sign in screen located in the nine box **Red Hat applications** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 

    [![gitea-signin](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-signin.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-signin.png)

    > **Note:** Alternatively, you can run the following command to obtain the Gitea user's password automatically:  
    >  
     ```sh
    > oc extract -n vp-gitea secret/gitea-admin-secret --to=- --keys=password 2>/dev/null
    > ```

5. In the `industrial-edge` repository, edit the file called `charts/datacenter/manuela-tst/templates/machine-sensor/machine-sensor-2-configmap.yaml`
and change `SENSOR_TEMPERATURE_ENABLED: "false"` to `SENSOR_TEMPERATURE_ENABLED: "true"` as shown in the screenshot.

    [![gitea-edit](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-edit.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-edit.png)

6. Commit this change to your git repository so that the change will be picked up by OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD).

    [![gitea-commit](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-commit.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-commit.png)

7. Track the progress of this commit/push in your OpenShift GitOps console in the `manuela-test-all` application. You will notice components regarding
machine-sensor-2 getting sync-ed. You can speed this up by manually pressing the `Refresh` button.

    [![argocd-line-dashboard](/images/industrial-edge/argocd-line-dashboard.png)](/images/industrial-edge/argocd-line-dashboard.png)

8. The dashboard app should pickup the change automatically, once data from the temperature sensor is received. Sometimes a page/tab refreshed is needed for the change to be picked up.

## Application changes using DevOps

The `line-dashboard` application has temperature sensors. 

In this demonstration you are going to make a simple change to that application, rebuild and redeploy
it. 

1. Edit the file `components/iot-frontend/src/app/app.component.html` in the `manuela-dev` repository there is a file

2. Change the
`<ion-title>IoT Dashboard</ion-title>` to for example,
`<ion-title>IoT Dashboard - DEVOPS was here!</ion-title>`. Do this in the
gitea web interface directly clicking on the editing icon for the file:

    [![gitea-iot-edit](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-iot-edit.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-iot-edit.png)

3. Commit this change to your git repository so that the change will be picked up by OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD).

    [![gitea-commit](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-commit.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-commit-1.png)

4. Kick off the pipeline called `build-and-test-iot-frontend` that will do the following:

    1. Rebuild the image from the manuela-dev code
    2. Push the change on the hub datacenter in the manuela-tst-all namespace
    3. Create a PR in gitea

    4.1 Start the pipeline by running the following command in `industrial-edge` repository:

    ```sh
    make build-and-test-iot-frontend
    ```

The pipeline will look a bit like the following:

[![tekton-pipeline](/images/industrial-edge/pipeline-iot-frontend.png)](/images/industrial-edge/pipeline-iot-frontend.png)

After the pipeline completed the `manuela-test` application in Argo will eventually refresh and push the changes to the cluster and the line dash board route in the `manuela-tst-all` namespace will have picked up the changes:

[![linedashboard-devops](/images/industrial-edge/line-dashboard-devops.png)](/images/industrial-edge/line-dashboard-devops.png)

    > **Note: You might need to clear your browser cache to see the change. 
   
The pipeline will also have created a PR in gitea, like the following one:

[![gitea-pipeline-pr](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-pipeline-pr.png)](/images/industrial-edge/gitea-pipeline-pr.png)

Verify that the change is correct on the datacenter in the `manuela-tst-all` line dashboard and if deemed correct, you can merge the PR in gitea which will roll out the change to the production factory!

## Application AI model changes with DevOps

1. On the OpenShift console click the nine-box and select `Red Hat OpenShift AI`. The AI console will open, appearing as follows:

    [![rhoai-console](/images/industrial-edge/rhoai-console-home.png)](/images/industrial-edge/rhoai-console-home.png)

2. Click the `Data Science Projects` on the left sidebar and choose the `ml-development` project. The project will open, containing a couple of workbenches and a model.:

    [![rhoai-ml-development](/images/industrial-edge/rhoai-ml-development.png)](/images/industrial-edge/rhoai-ml-development.png)

3. Click the `JupyterLab` workbench to open the notebook where this pattern's data analysis is performed. The `manuela-dev` code will be preloaded in the notebook. 

4. click the left file browser on `manuela-dev/ml-models/anomaly-detection/1-preprocessing.ipynb`:

    [![notebook-console](/images/industrial-edge/notebook-console.png)](/images/industrial-edge/notebook-console.png)

After opening the notebook successfully, walk through the demonstration by pressing play and iterating through the commands in the playbooks. Jupyter playbooks are interactive and you may make changes and also save those changes.

Running through all the six notebooks will automatically regenerate the anomaly model, prepare the data for the training and push the changes to the internal
gitea so the inference service can pick up the new model.
