= Tested environments

== Current version (4.*)

Version 4 is the first release of the pattern using Generally Available (GA) versions of the CoCo stack. All prior versions used Technology Preview releases of Trustee.

=== Supported components
- OpenShift Sandboxed Containers Operator 1.11
- Red Hat Build of Trustee 1.0 (first GA release)
- OpenShift Container Platform 4.17+
- cert-manager operator (stable-v1 channel)
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (for multi-cluster topology)
- HashiCorp Vault (secrets management)

=== Single cluster
Tested on Azure with the `simple` clusterGroup using self-managed OpenShift provisioned via `openshift-install`. In this topology all components — Trustee, Vault, ACM, sandboxed containers operator, and sample workloads — are deployed on a single cluster.

Worker nodes use `Standard_D8s_v5` or larger. Peer-pod VMs for confidential containers use `Standard_DC2as_v5` from the Azure confidential computing VM family. Azure DNS is required for the cluster's hosted zone.

=== Multiple clusters
Tested with `trusted-hub` + `spoke` clusterGroups on Azure, both using self-managed OpenShift.

- `trusted-hub`: Vault, ACM, Trustee (KBS + attestation service), cert-manager. This cluster acts as the trust anchor and ACM hub.
- `spoke`: Sandboxed containers operator, peer-pod infrastructure, and sample workloads (hello-openshift, kbs-access). Imported into ACM with the `clusterGroup=spoke` label.

The spoke cluster connects back to the hub's Trustee instance for attestation and secret retrieval. Secrets are synchronised from the hub's Vault to the spoke via the External Secrets operator.

== Version history

All pattern versions prior to v4 used Technology Preview (pre-GA) releases of Trustee. Version 4 is a breaking change that moves to GA components and adds multi-cluster support.
